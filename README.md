Show values from Arduino with Python using webpy

Hello,

The code is very basic. It was built to be simple.

I built the code to display values from photoresistors plugged into an Arduino on a simple webpage with webpy then draw a graph with the values using ChartJS. 

If you already know Python, I'm sure that there are better ways to built the code, dont forget, it was built to be simple and basic.Along with several friends, I was given a project at school, to build a simple solar tracker and eventually be able to get all possible values to be available on our local network. Turns out some of the other projects also need to display values on a webpage.Seen as most of my classmates cant code, so I bult this and decide to post it on github for other to use as well. Feel free to edit as you need!

Here is what you will need:
  - Linux (I haven't tested on windows )
  - Python
  - Webpy
  - Arduino
  - ChartJS
